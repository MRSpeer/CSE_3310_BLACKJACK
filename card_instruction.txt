Each card is going to be represented by a character.
A character is just a 1 byte number.

The order of representation is
Spades = 0x10
Hearts = 0x20
Clubs = 0x30
Diamonds = 0x40

and ace through kings is just 1 through d
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d

So an 3 of diamonds would be 0x43

If you need to create a card for whatever reason, use
SUIT | value
where SUIT is one of the four suits and value would be the value of the card



If you want to grab the value of a card, use

card & 0x0F

This is and-ing the character and 00001111, leaving only the value of the card
As an example:

0x43 & 0x0F = 0x03



To grab the suit use

(card & 0xF0) >> 4

This is and-ing the character and 11110000, and then shifting it over 4 bits, leaving a 1-4 number.
As an example:

0x43 & 0xF0 = 0x40
0x40 >> 4 = 0x04
